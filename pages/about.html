    <p class="about">I made this website because I am constanly re-looking up recipes
        and can't always remember where they're from or what ways I've changed
        them.  Some recipes are from websites, some are from my email, and
        some are from recipe books.  I tried my best to cite all my sources.  I'm already used to cooking from an online
        recipe so I just made this to help me have them all centralized.
        <br>
        <br>
        I designed this website with html and css by hand.  I didn't use
        any frameworks or special libraries.  It's also the first website I've
        ever designed which I'm sure is obvious from the website itself or from
        the code.  I made it partially to have something useful for myself
        and also to get some practice with html and css.  It's a bit of a work in progress.
        I'll probably gradually update the various categories and add recipes.
