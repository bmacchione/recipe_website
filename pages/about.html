    <p class="about">I made this website because I am constanly looking up the same recipes
        over and over again, and I can't always remember where they're from or what ways I've changed
        them.  Some recipes are from websites, some are from my email, and
        some are from recipe books.  I tried my best to cite all my sources.  I'm already used to cooking from an online
        recipe so I just made this to help me have them all centralized.
        <br>
        <br>
        I designed this website with html and css by hand.  I didn't use
        any frameworks or special libraries, and it's purposely simple.  I get frustrated trying to find an ingredient list somewhere buried in long blogs
        with constant advertisements/pop-ups.  It's also the first website I've
        ever designed which I'm sure is obvious from the website itself and/or from
        the code.  I made it partially to have something useful for myself
        and also to get some practice with html and css.  It's a bit of a work in progress.
        I'll probably gradually update the various categories and add recipes.
